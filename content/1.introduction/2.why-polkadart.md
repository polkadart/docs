## 💙 Why Dart for Blockchain?

### Familiar and Approachable

Dart's clean syntax makes blockchain development accessible:

```dart
// Simple and readable transaction code
final transfer = await polkadot.tx.balances
  .transfer(
    dest: recipientAddress,
    value: BigInt.from(1000000000000), // 1 DOT
  )
  .signAndSend(keyring);
```

### Built for Production

- **Sound null safety** prevents common bugs
- **Strong typing** catches errors early
- **Async/await** simplifies complex blockchain operations
- **Hot reload** speeds up development (Flutter)

### One Language, Many Platforms

Write once, deploy everywhere:
- 📱 **Mobile apps** with Flutter
